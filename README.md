## üß© Core Concepts

### Godot Fundamentals

- Understanding Nodes, Scenes, Scene Tree, and Signals.

### Scripting

- Using Godot‚Äôs native scripting language, GDScript, to control game logic.

### Editor Integration

- Connecting Godot with VSCode for an enhanced development workflow.

---

## üéÆ Player Mechanics

- Creating a movable player using `CharacterBody2D`.
- Adding animations with `AnimatedSprite2D` using free sprite sheets.
- Implementing collisions with `CollisionShape2D`.
- Adding `Camera2D` to follow the player smoothly.
- Handling frame and delta time for consistent movement speed.

---

## üèó World Building & Physics

- Designing a basic world with `TileMap` and `TileSet`.
- Creating endless horizontal ground using `CollisionShape2D`.
- Adding moving platforms with `AnimatableBody2D` and `Sprite2D`.
- Enabling one-way collisions on platforms.
- Animating platforms and enemies using `AnimationPlayer`.
- Using `RayCast2D` for collision detection to control enemy movement.

---

## ‚ö° Gameplay Mechanics

- **Collectibles:** Adding coins with `Area2D` and `_on_body_entered` signals.
- **Hazards:** Implementing ‚ÄòKillzone‚Äô areas for player death logic.
- **Enemies:** Creating basic enemy behavior and interactions.
- **Score:** Displaying dynamic score using GDScript and text nodes.
- **Input Handling:** Creating custom input maps for key bindings.
- **Node Interaction:** Connecting nodes to GDScript variables for dynamic control.

---

## üîä Audio

- Adding background music and sound effects for interactions, pickups, and events.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary of Achievements

- Movable player character with animations
- Basic 2D world using `TileSet` and `TileMap`
- Interactive moving platforms
- Collectible items and score system
- End game / dying mechanics
- Basic enemy creation and behavior
- Integrated audio and sound effects

---

## üöÄ Future Ideas

- Expand enemy AI and patrol behavior
- Add more complex level design with multiple tile layers
- Implement power-ups or special abilities
- Add UI for health, lives, or timer

## üìö Concept Summary & Key Classes

This project introduced several core Godot concepts and commonly used classes:

- **Nodes & Scenes:** The building blocks of Godot. Scenes are made of nodes, which can have scripts, collisions, visuals, and more.
- **Signals:** Used for communication between nodes (e.g., `_on_body_entered` for collision events).
- **CharacterBody2D:** Represents a player or moving character with built-in physics methods.
- **AnimatedSprite2D:** Handles sprite animations using sprite sheets.
- **CollisionShape2D:** Defines collision areas for physics interactions.
- **Camera2D:** Follows the player or focuses on a specific part of the scene.
- **TileMap & TileSet:** Used for 2D world building and tile-based maps.
- **Area2D:** Detects overlaps and triggers events (e.g., pickups, hazards).
- **AnimationPlayer:** Plays animations on nodes, used for platforms, enemies, and effects.
- **RayCast2D:** Detects obstacles or edges for enemy movement or interactions.
- **AudioStreamPlayer2D:** Plays sounds or music in the scene.
